Why This Order?
Phase 1-3 build the backbone: Projects → Applications → Assignments → Completion. You’ll have a functional MVP where clients post, freelancers apply, clients select, freelancers confirm, and projects complete.

Phase 4 ensures safety & trust: Handling disputes and cancellations is critical to avoid fraud and bad experiences.

Phase 5 improves UX & scalability: Messaging, milestones, and analytics add polish and value but aren’t critical at the start.

Quick Note on API design & status handling:
Use your status enum:
open → pending (selected but not confirmed) → in-progress → completed / cancelled / dispute

Control updates & edits based on project status to keep data integrity.

Keep track of timestamps like acceptedAt, completedAt to allow undo or audit.
